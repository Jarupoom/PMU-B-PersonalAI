# PMU-B-PersonalAI Introduction ðŸ”°
Welcome to my e-portfolio! I am Jarupoom Kaewkham, a passionate student in the field of AI-based Biomedical Engineering. With a strong foundation in both artificial intelligence and biomedical engineering, I aim to bridge the gap between cutting-edge technology and healthcare innovation.

Biomedical engineering is evolving rapidly, and the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming how we diagnose, treat, and monitor diseases. Through this portfolio, I am excited to showcase my projects, skills, and experiences in applying AI techniques to solve complex problems in medical fields.

# Xpore: An AI-Powered App for Bioinformatic
xPore is a computational tool specifically designed for analyzing RNA modifications from nanopore direct RNA sequencing data. Its primary purpose is to identify differential RNA modificationsâ€”such as N6-methyladenosine (m6A)â€”at a single-base resolution, quantify modification rates, and compare them across different conditions or samples. xPore achieves this by leveraging nanopore sequencing's ability to directly detect base modifications through changes in the electrical signal, unlike other RNA-seq methods that require reverse transcription.

Key features of xPore include:

1. Identification of modification sites: xPore identifies positions on RNA where modifications occur, like m6A, at single-nucleotide resolution.


2. Quantification of modification rates: It estimates the fraction of modified RNA molecules within a sample.


3. Comparison between conditions: xPore can detect significant differences in RNA modification rates across conditions, such as disease states, different cell types, or treatments.


4. Single-experiment analysis: It enables both RNA modification detection and differential expression analysis from the same high-throughput dataset, saving resources.

# TinySleepNet: Learning from Biosignals
TinySleepNet is a lightweight and efficient deep learning model specifically designed for automatic sleep stage scoring based on raw, single-channel EEG signals. Its primary goal is to simplify sleep stage classification while maintaining high accuracy, even when dealing with limited and class-imbalanced datasets.

Key features of TinySleepNet include:

1. Efficiency: It has fewer trainable parameters compared to existing deep learning models, requiring less training data and computational resources while delivering competitive performance.


2. End-to-End Training: The model processes raw EEG signals directly, eliminating the need for complex preprocessing like converting signals to spectrograms.


3. Robust Training Techniques: TinySleepNet incorporates data augmentation methods that improve robustness against time shifts and prevent overfitting by randomizing sleep stage sequences.


4. Generalization: The model has been tested across multiple public datasets with diverse characteristics, showing consistent accuracy and adaptability to various recording conditions and scoring criteria.

# AI for detecting code plagiarism
Merry is a web-based code clone detection system designed to help developers identify duplicated code segmentsâ€”known as code clonesâ€”in software projects. By leveraging machine learning techniques, Merry detects both syntactic and semantic code clones, which can help reduce redundancy, improve code quality, and maintainability.

Key Features of Merry:

1. Code Clone Detection:

Detects duplicated or similar code fragments in software projects using advanced machine learning models like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests.

It analyzes code syntactically (structure) and semantically (behavior) to capture a broader range of clones.



2. Machine Learning Integration:

Utilizes code embeddings and tools like Code2Vec to represent code for detection.

Supports training and fine-tuning models for improved accuracy on real-world projects.

# BitNet : AI for diagnosing ultrasound image 
BiTNet is an advanced AI system developed to assist in diagnosing cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer) using ultrasound images. It was created by researchers at Khon Kaen University in Thailand to combat liver fluke disease, a major cause of cholangiocarcinoma prevalent in the Mekong Sub-region.

BiTNet leverages AI and deep learning techniques to analyze ultrasound images for abnormalities in the upper abdomen. It identifies individuals at risk of cholangiocarcinoma, helping radiologists achieve greater accuracy while reducing their workload. Specifically:

It enhances diagnostic accuracy by up to 12%.

It reduces radiologists' workload by 35%.

It boasts an impressive 96% accuracy rate in detecting individuals at risk for cholangiocarcinoma.

# AI for arresting criminals
YOLO stands for "You Only Look Once" and is a real-time object detection algorithm widely used in computer vision tasks. Developed by Joseph Redmon and his team, YOLO revolutionized object detection by offering speed and accuracy in a single neural network pass.

Key Feature of YOLO:

1. Object Detection: YOLO identifies and locates multiple objects within an image or video frame by drawing bounding boxes around them and assigning class labels.


2. Single Pass Analysis: Unlike older methods (e.g., R-CNN), YOLO processes the entire image in one forward pass through the network, making it extremely fast and efficient.


3. Real-Time Applications: Due to its speed, YOLO is suitable for real-time applications like:

Surveillance systems

Autonomous vehicles

Robotics

Real-time video analytics


# How YOLO Works:

The image is divided into a grid (e.g., 7x7).

Each grid cell predicts:

Bounding boxes (object locations).

Confidence scores (certainty that an object exists).

Class probabilities (object type, e.g., car, dog, person).


Predictions are combined to produce accurate detections.

 # Mental Disorder detection from Social Media Use:
LIWC-22 (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) is a sophisticated text analysis tool used to evaluate the psychological, emotional, and cognitive aspects of language. By analyzing the words people use, LIWC-22 can identify patterns related to a personâ€™s emotions, thinking styles, social connections, and even broader psychological states.

Key Features of LIWC-22:

1. Text Categorization: It compares text to an internal dictionary of over 12,000 words, stems, phrases, and even emoticons, which are organized into 100+ psychological categories such as emotion, cognition, tone, and social concerns. For example, words like happy or excited reflect positive emotions, while angry or mad indicate negative emotions.


2. Psychological and Social Analysis: LIWC-22 allows researchers to quantify and analyze subtle linguistic cues, such as pronoun usage or emotional tone, which can reveal underlying social dynamics, confidence levels, or psychological health.


3. Modules for Advanced Analysis:

Contextualizer: Examines words within their surrounding context to deepen analysis.

Case Studies: Provides tools to closely analyze individual texts.

Narrative Arc: Tracks changes in linguistic patterns across different sections of a narrative.

Language Style Matching: Measures how similar linguistic styles are between texts.



4. Adaptability: LIWC-22 is designed to analyze a variety of text formats, from traditional prose to modern digital communication (e.g., tweets or SMS) by accommodating netspeak, emoticons, and phrases like b4 or :).


5. Probabilistic Analysis: LIWC avoids overly rigid interpretations of word usage. It uses probabilistic models, meaning the reliability of the output improves with larger text samples.
